The character picks up items when walked over (if there's space). When the player steps on an item, it's description (truncated to 77 characters) is shown at the bottom. The player can use the commands to open menus and interact with items. If a light is equipped, it's ATTR field +3 is used as the light radius (still a square). Thus, the Wicked Lasers(R) Torch lights up everything (radius of 200). Sections that are illuminated are highlighted in bold. The player's attributes are affected with the equip and unequip methods, which also manage the equipment slots (nothing else should).
