By default, the dungeon is generated as per assignment 1.01.
If the program is run with the --load flag, then the dungeon is loaded from %HOME%/.rlg327/dungeon.rlg327
If the program is run with the --save flag, then the dungeon (generated or loaded) is saved to %HOME%/.rlg327/dungeon.rlg327
On a load or generation, the PC is placed into the middle of a room (in 'special' dungeons this may cause a problem with pathfinding as the PC could spawn without being in a room). This placement of the PC works for ordinary rectangular rooms.

The loading and saving are set up as a library that the main code references. All code that works with the data files directly is in save.c
