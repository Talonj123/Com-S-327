The dungeon is generated as per Assignment 1.01.
The --load and --save flags act as defined in Assignment 1.02.
Pathfinding distance maps are generated as defined by Assignment 1.03.
The Monsters move according to Assignment 1.04.
IO is handled according to Assignment 1.05.
Characters and fog of ware are implemented according to assignment 1.06.
Monster and object templates are parsed according to assignment 1.07.

The monsters are not added from the list of parsed monster templates (add_monsters(...)) as are objects (add_items(...)). When the PC walks over an object, its name and description are displayed at the bottom of the terminal. Combat semantics are unchanged. This is not a particularly hard assignment. I did turn the dungeon into a class, the initialization is not in a constructor and the release of resources in a destructor.
