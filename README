By default, the dungeon is generated as per assignment 1.01.
The --load and --save flags act as defined in Assignment 1.02.

After the dungeon is obtained (loaded/generated), the PC is put in the center of a random room (may cause issues in non-rectangular dungeons).
Two distance maps are generated for tunnelling and non-tunnelling monsters using dijkstra's (edge weights of 1 for non-tunnelling map). These maps are printed out to the console.
My priority queue is not fancy, it has linear add and reduce priority operations, which seems to be suficent thus far. The reason I haven't switched to Dr. Scheaffer's heap is that I like my generic setup, and don't want to migrate everything to a new interface.
