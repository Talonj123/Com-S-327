The dungeon is a 2D map with walls, halls and rooms. The characters can traverse through any open space (rooms and halls), some mosnters can tunnel.
There are various items scattered throughout the dungeon (use --numitm to set how many), these items persist between levels.
To advance or retreat a level, use the stairs (< and >) press the '<' or '>' key on the corresponding stair to travel, your items will stay with you.
Some items have level-dependant properties, weapons can become more powerful as you descend, but armor has to be replaced to get the improvements.
Use the number pad to travel. To edit enemies or items, see ~/.rlg327/monster_data.txt and ~/.rlg327/object_data.txt.

The character picks up items when walked over (if there's space). When the player steps on an item, it's description (truncated to 77 characters) is shown at the bottom. The player can use the commands to open menus and interact with items. If a light is equipped, it's ATTR field +3 is used as the light radius (still a square). Thus, the Wicked Lasers(R) Torch lights up everything (radius of 200). Sections that are illuminated are highlighted in bold. The player's attributes are affected with the equip and unequip methods, which also manage the equipment slots (nothing else should).
