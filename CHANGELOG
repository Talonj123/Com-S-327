# Change Log

## 2016-09-14
### changes
 - Fixed memory allocation bug when loading a dungeon (allocating space for a pointer, instead of the struct)

## 2016-09-10
### Changes
 - Fixed pathfinding in loaded dungeons
 - Fixed pathfinding in generated dungeons

## 2016-09-09
### Additions
 - Added pathfinding, it dosn't completely work though
 
## 2106-09-04
### Changes
 - Updated the clean rules in makefiles
 - Switched to pointers in the tile struct for getting neighboring tiles (a proper graph structure)
### Additions
 - Save/load code with optional filename parameters
 - Code to check for/create the data directory under the user's HOME directory

## 2016-09-01
### Changes
 - Refactored old library code into folders with separate makefiles (there are horizontal dependancies, but this is to make finding files easier)
 - switch the default room type to rectangular and chaged the command-line flag accordingly (-rect got replaced by --round)

## 2016-08-30
### Additions
 - Rectangular rooms (selected with the -rect switch) can be provided instead of round ones by the get_dungeon() function
 - Aspect ration constraints for the rectangular rooms (round rooms don't need this)

## 2016-08-30
### Changes
 - Fixed bug in array allocation for lists
 - Tuned the room placement and corridor generation parameters
 - Fixed the examples generator in the Makefie
### Additions
 - Turn cost to imcrease the straightness of corridors
 - Added a heuristic to Dijkstra's making it A*
 - Hardness domains, the rock hardness is set for an area and the regions are softened

## 2016-08-29
### Changes
 - Fixed priority queue insert function
### Additions
 - Corridor generation

## 2016-08-28
### Additions
 - Got basic room generation working (rooms actually are affected by rock hardness)
 - Priority Queue implementation (similar to queue, but with insertion sort on insert)
### Changes
 - Improved room placement (I think, produces more equal sized rooms)
 
## 2016-08-26
### Additions
 - Some basic dungeon types (tiles, etc)
 - Some basic dungeon space generation (array creation and random rock hardness)
 - A 'generic' queue, see queue_README for details
